## Proposal					
										
					
SupplementMe is an interactive health survey that produces a personalized bundle of supplement products based on the user's answers. Users will answer a series of questions regarding their health. A list of suggested supplemental products will populate on the results page based on the user's answers. Users will be able to see products available both in store and online. Users will also be given articles related the products. The objective is to help users identify their supplmental needs.					
					
SupplementMe will use Amazon(pending) or eBay(pending) and Walmart(confirmed) API to display multiple options of the same product category. For example if a user is in need of Vitamin D, they will receive two options for Vitamin D supplements to purchase - one from an online source and one from a physical location. The site will also display articles using NutrionX/My Fitness Pal/ Medical News (all pending) related to the products they see on the results page. This will provide users with multiple brands and prices enabling users to choose the product(s) that fit their budget and needs.
